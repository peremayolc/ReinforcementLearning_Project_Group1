Here you will find instructions on how to use each part of the repository, with links to everything and explanaitions on how things work. 

## FOR ASSAULT:
In this case, we have tried two different algorithms:
### 1. PPO
For the PPO model used to solve the Assault environment, there are various important parts, including the final model, the videos of the trained model and also the trials done during the different stages of the project. The first importatn thing would be the folder where you can find the final model, the best performing and the one that resulted as the ultimate goal for us. 
Here you can find the [FINAL PPO MODEL](https://github.com/peremayolc/ReinforcementLearning_Project_Group1/tree/main/Pere/PPO_ASSAULT/FINAL).
