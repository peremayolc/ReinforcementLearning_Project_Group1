Here you will find instructions on how to use each part of the repository, with links to everything and explanaitions on how things work. 

## FOR ASSAULT:
In this case, we have tried two different algorithms:
### 1. PPO
#### For the PPO model used to solve the Assault environment, there are various important parts, including the final model, the videos of the trained model and also the trials done during the different stages of the project.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The first important thing would be the folder where you can find the final model, the best performing and the one that resulted as the ultimate goal for us. 
Here you can find the [FINAL PPO MODEL](https://github.com/peremayolc/ReinforcementLearning_Project_Group1/tree/main/Pere/PPO_ASSAULT/FINAL), and all files used and that resulted in the training process. 
- The [PYTHON FILE](https://github.com/peremayolc/ReinforcementLearning_Project_Group1/blob/main/Pere/PPO_ASSAULT/FINAL/assault_ppo_scheduler_test3_longest.py) containing all the code used.
- The [TRAINING PLOT](https://github.com/peremayolc/ReinforcementLearning_Project_Group1/blob/main/Pere/PPO_ASSAULT/FINAL/training_plot_long2048.png).
- The [MODEL](https://github.com/peremayolc/ReinforcementLearning_Project_Group1/blob/main/Pere/PPO_ASSAULT/FINAL/ASSAULT_PPOlong2048.zip).
- The [JOB FILE](https://github.com/peremayolc/ReinforcementLearning_Project_Group1/blob/main/Pere/PPO_ASSAULT/FINAL/job-55865.log) containing all the training process information saved along the way.
  
Moreover, we can find a folder where the performance of the saved final model has been tested -> [FOLDER TEST VIDEOS](https://github.com/peremayolc/ReinforcementLearning_Project_Group1/tree/main/Pere/PPO_ASSAULT/FINAL_SCHEDULER_VIDEOS_TEST). Here we can find the [VIDEOS](https://github.com/peremayolc/ReinforcementLearning_Project_Group1/tree/main/Pere/PPO_ASSAULT/FINAL_SCHEDULER_VIDEOS_TEST/videos) for the trained and untrained model, for comparison and ensure good performance, along with the [PYTHON FILE](https://github.com/peremayolc/ReinforcementLearning_Project_Group1/blob/main/Pere/PPO_ASSAULT/FINAL_SCHEDULER_VIDEOS_TEST/TEST_PPOASSAULT.py) used to generate them.
